This is a Judging app for the Ultimate Software Hackathon.
The judging will be done using Block Chaining which will help ensure that there
is one vote per judge.
There will be:
              Live results
              Ways to add hackathons
              Ways to take notes on each project
              Ways to view and vote on each project
